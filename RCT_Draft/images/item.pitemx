Data creation involved input from watershed coordinators from the Upper Missouri Headwaters Basin and Upper Yellowstone watersheds, then complication from USFWS R6 Science Applications and Montana State University. Leveraging the investment of the USFWS Region 6 Science Applications\u2019 funded project Building Large Scale Drought Resiliency in the Missouri Headwaters Basin, the tool further supports stakeholders in drought management planning by improving access to US Geological Survey, Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks, and Montana Dept. of Natural Resources Conservation Services (DNRC) river condition data. In collaboration with MT DNRC, this data drives functionality similar to the River Conditions tool on the Big Hole River Conditions web page for eight basins within the Missouri Headwaters Basin. The tool is to be embedded on websites for easy access to real-time stream conditions such as temperature and flow, and river status (e.g., restrictions, closures).<\/span><\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div>","tags":["River Conditions Tool","Upper Missouri Headwaters","Upper Yellowstone"],"snippet":"This map service supports the river conditions tool.
